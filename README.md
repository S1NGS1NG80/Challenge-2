# Challenge-2
Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description
This is a website that gives the user a brief background of myself, links to some of my work and away to contact me.
It showcases the use of html and CSS formating and techniques, such as linking to different sections, such as
'About me', 'Websites' and 'Contact'.
It is fairly simple and barebones for now. I hope to improve my coding skills during this Bootcamp!
